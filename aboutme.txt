About me.

I've always been an explorer of the unknown. As a child, science ignited my curiosity, taught me to question everything, and to find beauty in the "why" of things. Over time, that passion merged with art, design, and the need to create. Today, my path encompasses software development, photography, teaching, and design. Every line of code, every image, and every idea I sketch is a reflection of that restlessness that never fades. Because learning, innovating, and sharing knowledge isn't just what I do... it's who I am.
