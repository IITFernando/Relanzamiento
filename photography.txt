A lifelong amateur photographer,
I started with a simple automatic camera, then explored the world of film SLRs, and today I enjoy digital photography. I'm passionate about capturing beauty in the everyday, from still lifes and food photography to landscapes, macro, and minimalist abstraction. Photography is my way of observing, of feeling moved, and of finding art in every detail. (Click to go to Instagram)
